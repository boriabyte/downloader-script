# Downloader (and soon to be installer) script - Mozilla verison (currently)


I originally created this script in order to automatize and make the downloading & installing of mods for my Star Wars games less tricky and less "intensive" (having to go to each of the webpages,
clicking the download links, waiting, saving them, opening them, having to search for them yadda-yadda. This was necessary as (I think) the number of mods I install every playthrough exceeeds 100 so this kind of became a necessity


The libraries are used are simple

  - Selenium for the Mozilla Webdriver
  - BeautifulSoup for the webscraping tools
  - Requests for the connection to the site
